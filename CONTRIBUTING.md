# Guide to Contributing

### Team Norms:

-If team members disagree on how to proceed on a certain part of the project and cannot come to a resolution internally, the issue can be brought up in a meeting where the whole group can attempt to find a solution.

-If a team member needs help on work they can ask a question in the team discord or bring it up at a meeting.

-If a member knows that they will not be able to finish work by their assigned deadline, they should reach out to the group for help of for someone to take on their work.

### Git Workflow: 
Forking workflow.

### Rules of Contributing:

-Work will be distributed in a meeting during the start of each sprint, and the preliminary deadlines will be agreed upon.

-Prior to deadlines the team will meet again in order to patch out any inconsistencies and finish up leftover work. Each team member is expected to complete assigned work on time.

-Submitted code should be reasonably bug free and optimized.

-Code should be pushed to github promptly in order to avoid problems when merging.

-Team members are expected to come to meetings if possible. Members should come prepared and contribute ideas during meetings. It is mandatory to come to at least one meeting a week.

-Biweekly standups required so that people are on the same page regarding the team’s progress.

-The current scrum master and product owners take on the additional work that the positions entail.
